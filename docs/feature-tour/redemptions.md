# Redemptions

## Partial Redemption
Redeeming a voucher is straightforward - the amount on the voucher is subtracted from the total for a customers order. But what happens when the customers order total is larger than the voucher value, or vice-versa?

Fortunately, Gift Voucher has partial redemption built-in, and is smart enough to know when only a partial amount needs to be subtracted from the voucher, or if the customer needs to make up the difference. Vouchers continue to be redeemable with the remaining amount until the expiry date is reached.

## Redemption Tracking
Redemptions are also tracked every time a voucher code is used in an order. A record with the associated code, order and amount is created, which can be viewed from a single voucher code page in the control panel.
