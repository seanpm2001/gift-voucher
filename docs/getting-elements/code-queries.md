# Code Queries
You can fetch codes in your templates or PHP code using **code queries**.

:::code
```twig Twig
{# Create a new code query #}
{% set myQuery = craft.giftVoucher.codes() %}
```

```php PHP
// Create a new code query
$myQuery = \verbb\giftvoucher\elements\Code::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created a code query, you can set parameters on it to narrow down the results, and then execute it by calling `.all()`. An array of [Code](docs:developers/code) objects will be returned.

:::tip
See Introduction to [Element Queries](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/element-queries/) in the Craft docs to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example
We can display codes for a given order by doing the following:

1. Create a code query with `craft.giftVoucher.codes()`.
2. Set the [orderId](#orderId) a [limit](#limit) parameters on it.
3. Fetch all codes with `.all()` and output.
4. Loop through the codes using a [for](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/for.html) tag to output the contents.

```twig
{# Create a codes query with the 'orderId' and 'limit' parameters #}
{% set codesQuery = craft.giftVoucher.codes()
    .orderId(order.id)
    .limit(10) %}

{# Fetch the Codes #}
{% set codes = codesQuery.all() %}

{# Display their contents #}
{% for code in codes %}
    <p>{{ code.codeKey }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

## Parameters
Code queries support the following parameters:

<!-- BEGIN PARAMS -->

### `after`
Narrows the query results to only codes that were posted on or after a certain date.

Possible values include:
